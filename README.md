Then, prior to execution of "server.js" contained in the directory of the utility, the should run: (1) the command "npm install" in the local directory containing the utiltiy to install the dependencies, (2) the code in db/schema.sql in the MySQL terminal to create the database, (3) the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with data for manipulation, and (4) "npm start" to execute the server.js file in the local directory.  All of these steps are demonstrated in the video link provided above.
